# Hangman

This is a game of Hangman I created and implemented from basics I learned from Python.

# What is Hangman?

Hangman is a word guessing game many of us played growing up due to it's accessibility - typically only needing two players and pen/paper. 

This program enables the game to be playable as a single player game.

For those unfamiliar, full rundown of the rules can be found [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman).

# Installation

Ensure that you have Git Bash enabled in your terminal. Then use this:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shaikhuli1/hangman.git
